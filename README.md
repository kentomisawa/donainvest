# Donainvest

Donainvest is a donation-investment platform on which the market cap is in proportion to the social impact and social workers are able to continuously fundraise without crypto-related licenses.

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

## What It Does

### Fundraising Without a Crypto-Related License

Social workers can raise funds with [this protocol](https://github.com/kentomisawa/lfico), therefore everyone can easily offer tokens without any license. 

### Donation And Investment

Integrating donation and investment is a great way for social organizations to fundraise. Users pay and invest money not only for social organizations but also for themselves. The combination of self-oriented investment and altruistic donation is exponentially powerful.

### Connecting To Capitalism

Social workers work in a market where capitalism doesn't work well; that means it is hard for social organizations to get sophisticated as the *invisible hand* works. Donainvest integrates social works and capitalism. Then, that visualizes the needs of what the society really desires and how social projects make social impact.

#### The Relation Between Social Impact and A Market Cap

A market cap is in proportion to how much people want to support the project. Because there are no other incentives like dividends or ownerships. Although there is another incentive which is expectations of token value increases in the future, it comes from the social impact that the project makes. 

## How It Works

### Token Offering

It's confusing but there is no concept of "price" of offered tokens. It's about value change. The value of each token would be different, though the tokens are issued by the same project.

### Donation

Users choose what percentage of tokens to donate when they buy. It's like an exchange fee but how much users pay is up to them. The more donation, the more bonus value the purchased token will get if the market cap gets bigger. Project owners set the *Donation Bonus Power*; it is a variable to determine how much bonuses users receive from their donations. There is a tradeoff between the market cap and the amount of donation. If a project owner wants to earn more income from donations, the Donation Bonus Power should be set higher. On the other hand, if the project owner wants users to get profits more, they should set the Donation Bonus Power lower. Project owners can change it anytime later. This is a little like capital increase as companies do.

### Risk Hedging

Project owners have to hedge risks for users because unexpected asset loss causes restrictions on the purchase of the tokens. To prevent that, project owners set the *Value Guarantee Rate*. It is the rate of the values that users never lose related to the purchased values. Users also determine the rate to guarantee the part of held token values, but users cannot set the *Value Guarantee Rate* less than the project owner sets. This rate might be different from jurisdictions in which target users exist. Project owners must consider the *Value Guarantee Rate* is safe enough not to be regulated and to protect users from huge asset loss. Those values are quoted by Universal Static Price which is static over time, moreover, better to quote by than any fiat currency. Therefore, token values are stably backed in the pool and guaranteed by the *Value Guarantee Rate* against fluctuation.

### Investment

The issued tokens are a kind of NFTs. Because amounts of donations and *Value Guarantee Rate* are different for individuals; the more donation the more bonus value and the higher *Value Guarantee Rate* the less volatility. If tokens are purchased by the same amount of donations and at the same *Value Guarantee Rate*, every issued token is at the same volatility. Investment returns are differentiated by donation and *Value Guarantee Rate*. That seems hard to use those tokens, however, it is easy to pay with because they are coupled with the DEX, and can be swappable or transferable.

#### Donation Bonuses and Investment Returns

There are two factors that users get values with, which are Donation Bonuses and Investment Returns. Donation Bonuses are derived from the amount of donation and *Donation Bonus Power*, Investment Returns are derived from the amount of purchased tokens and *Value Guarantee Rate* (and *Donation Bonus Power*). If a user earns profits by 10% of tokens, another may earn 5% or 15% of profits. It is various to users.

### KYC, AML/CFT, etc

Due to the exemption of crypto-related licenses for project owners, it's not able for anonymous users to transfer or exchange tokens. Users have to get permission from regulated organizations. If any exchanges don't allow a user to exchange, the user may not able to get an investment return, but still, offering tokens are feasible without any licenses because that is completely the same as selling a dynamic pricing product at the moment of the "offering" in this case. Although, whether users can exchange with what currencies without permission is what project owners decide respective to each jurisdiction. In many jurisdictions, it may be possible to exchange only with their own fiat currencies without permission because that is just purchase and payback of dynamic pricing products.
